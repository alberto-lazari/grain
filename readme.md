# ðŸŒ¾ Grain

A C++ memory manager for grain-sized objects.

Developed as final project of the *Advanced C++* course for the Master in Computer Game Development.


## Overview

The project is based on Andrei Alexandrescu's `SmallObjectAllocator`,
described in his *Modern C++ Design* book.

The generic, long names he used in his implementation looked pretty ugly to me,
so I gave them a farming twist,
mapping each to a concrete item related to grains of wheat
(symbolizing small objects in memory):
| Name      | Analogy                                 | Original Name          |
| --------- | --------------------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| `Silo`    | Main storage, serves memory allocations | `SmallObjectAllocator` |
| `Sack`    | Fixed-size storage of wheat             | `FixedAllocator`       |
| `Handful` | A small handful of grains               | `Chunk`                |
