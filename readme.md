# ðŸŒ¾ Grain

A C++ memory manager for grain-sized objects.

Developed as final project of the *Advanced C++* course for the Master in Computer Game Development.


## Overview

The project is based on Andrei Alexandrescu's `SmallObjectAllocator`,
described in his *Modern C++ Design* book.

The generic, long names he used in his implementation looked pretty ugly to me,
so I decided to give them a farming twist,
mapping each to a concrete item related to grains of wheat:

| Name      | Analogy                                  | Original Name          |
| --------- | ---------------------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| `Granary` | Main storage of different kinds of grain | `SmallObjectAllocator` |
| `Sack`    | Set of grains of the same kind (size)    | `FixedAllocator`       |
| `Handful` | A small handful of grains                | `Chunk`                |
| `Grain`   | Smallest distributable unit              | Memory block           |

> This is a simple University project, aiming to replicate an existing implementation,

> I just wanted to have some fun while working on it.


## Build and Test

The project comes with a cross-platform CMake configuration.
You can build the project from the command line or open it as a folder in Visual Studio,
leaving it to the IDE to automatically load the targets.

Tests are split into separate executables that you can run from the CMake targets. \
On POSIX you can run them all with a simple `make test`.
